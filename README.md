# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
## Results

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
## Summary
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
    * Over 90k roles will need to be filled as a result of the "silver tsunami"
    * ![Retiring employees by titles](https://github.com/krockway/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/retiring_titles.png)

* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    * There is an abundance of retirement-ready employees (those born between 1952-1955) who could participate as mentors. Unfortunately there are only 1,940 employees who meet the mentorship-eligibility metrics (those born in 1965). 
    * ![Mentee employees by titles](https://github.com/krockway/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/mentee_titles.png)
    * In order for Pewlett Hackard to survive the "silver tsunami", it would be wise to open the mentee eligibility to additional years.
    * This would also be a wise time for the HR department to review roles of soon-to-be exiting employees and their importance within the organization. Can any technology, training or streamlining be added to reduce the number of roles that need to be filled.
