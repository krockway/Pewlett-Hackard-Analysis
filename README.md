* ![Mentee employees by titles](https://github.com/krockway/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Images/mentee_titles.png)
* Majority of those retiring are Senior Engineer (29,414) or Senior Staff (28,255)
* Majority of those eligible for mentorship program are Engineer (486) and Senior Staff (462)
* PH should focus on mentoring their engineering team as they are the bulk of the staff overall, and a significant number will be retiring soon
* There mentorship program should not focus on managers, as there are few within the org overall and few who will be retiring soon.

* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    * There is an abundance of retirement-ready employees (those born between 1952-1955) who could participate as mentors. Unfortunately there are only 1,940 employees who meet the mentorship-eligibility metrics (those born in 1965). 
    * ![Mentee employees by titles](https://github.com/krockway/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Images/mentee_titles.png)
    * In order for Pewlett Hackard to survive the "silver tsunami", it would be wise to open the mentee eligibility to additional years.
    * This would also be a wise time for the HR department to review roles of soon-to-be exiting employees and their importance within the organization. Can any technology, training or streamlining be added to reduce the number of roles that need to be filled.
